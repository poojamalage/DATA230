IPL Data Analysis Visualization

In this report, the idea is to analyze the IPL data(2008-2020) hosted by Kaggle to come up with a visualization dashboard that would help BCCI Board of directors to understand how successful the league has been ,the top and bottom performing teams in IPL over 11 years and many other facts which can help them make decisions for upcoming IPL for 2021.
This dashboard will also show detailed statistics of each team's performance over each season, what factors contribute to the success of team, overall team performance in every season, number of matches held in each city, number of matches won by each team, number of matches held every season, top batsmen and bowlers ,etc.
This dashboard will summarize these events with ease to understand and visualize the data, which will help the board of directors and planner make decisions and start preparation for this yearâ€™s matches.
